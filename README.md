# Wadworks
Wadworks is a unique experiment on the Stargaze blockchain leveraging NFTs from the WadSquad collection. By minting one of the WadWardrobe contracts, holders can exchange a WadSquad NFT for a custom printed T-shirt.

## Contract Details
The contract offers the following terms:

**Minting Cost**: The cost to mint one of these contracts is the floor price of The WadSquad NFT project, which is currently around 200 STARS tokens.

**Redemption**: Once you mint one, the holder has the right to send a WadSquad NFT artwork to the contract wallet along with a request for a T-shirt with that artwork printed on it.

This creates a unique economic cycle where holders potentially can obtain a unique, personalized T-shirt for as little as $5 worth of WadSquad NFTs.
